# AICN Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the cleanup activities performed on the AICN project to remove unwanted files and conflicting code.

## Files Analyzed
The following directories and files were analyzed:
- Root project directory
- admin-features/
- user-features/
- config/
- services/
- scripts/
- templates/
- import/

## Duplicate Files Identified
Several files with the same name were found, but they serve different purposes:

1. **dashboard.html** - Two separate files for admin and user dashboards
   - `admin-features/dashboard/dashboard.html` - Admin dashboard
   - `user-features/dashboard/dashboard.html` - User dashboard

2. **notifications.html** - Two separate files for admin and user notifications
   - `admin-features/notifications/notifications.html` - Admin notifications
   - `user-features/notifications/notifications.html` - User notifications

3. **README.md** - Two separate documentation files
   - `README.md` - Main project documentation
   - `import/README.md` - Documentation for import functionality

These files are not duplicates but serve different purposes and should be kept.

## Unwanted Code Identified
Multiple console.log statements were found in JavaScript files that should be removed for production:

### admin-features/notifications/notifications.js
- Lines with console.log statements used for debugging

### admin-features/room/room.js
- Lines with console.log statements used for debugging

## Cleanup Actions Performed
1. Removed all debug console.log statements from JavaScript files
2. Verified that all files serve a distinct purpose and should be kept
3. Confirmed no actual duplicate or conflicting code files exist in the project

## Files Removed
No files were removed as all identified files serve a distinct purpose in the application.

## Code Quality Improvements
- Removed unnecessary debug console.log statements from production code
- Maintained clean, production-ready codebase
- Improved code performance by eliminating unnecessary logging

## Verification
All functionality has been verified to work correctly after cleanup. The application has been tested and confirmed to be working without the debug statements.
