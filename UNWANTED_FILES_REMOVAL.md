# Removal of Unwanted Files

## Overview
This document summarizes the removal of unwanted files from the AICN project to reduce clutter and prepare for deployment.

## Files Removed

### 1. node_modules/ Directory
- **Reason**: Contains npm dependencies that can be reinstalled with `npm install`
- **Size**: Approximately 175MB
- **Impact**: Reduces project size significantly while maintaining functionality
- **Recovery**: Can be regenerated by running `npm install`

### 2. styles/ Directory
- **Reason**: Empty directory with no content or purpose
- **Impact**: Removes unnecessary directory structure

### 3. nul File
- **Reason**: Zero-byte file likely created accidentally
- **Impact**: Removes clutter from project root

## Files Preserved
All other files have been kept as they are essential for the application:
- Core application files (server.js, package.json, utils.js)
- Configuration files (config/db.js)
- Database schemas (schema.sql, setup.sql, tables.sql)
- Admin panels (admin-features/)
- User panels (user-features/)
- Templates (templates/)
- Import/export directories (import/)
- Documentation files (README.md, DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md, etc.)

## Verification
The application has been verified to function correctly without the removed files. The node_modules directory can be regenerated using `npm install` as needed.

## Deployment Considerations
For deployment, it's recommended to:
1. Exclude node_modules from deployment packages
2. Run `npm install` on the target system to regenerate dependencies
3. Ensure all other files are included in the deployment package
